\description{
Fits an (excess) hazard model with (multidimensional) penalized splines allowing for
time-dependent effects, non-linear effects and interactions between several continuous covariates. The linear predictor is specified on the logarithm of the (excess) hazard. Smooth terms are represented using
cubic regression splines with associated quadratic penalties. For multidimensional smooths, tensor product splines or tensor product interactions
are available. Smoothness is estimated automatically by optimizing one of two criteria: Laplace approximate marginal likelihood (LAML) or likelihood cross-validation (LCV).
When specifying the model's formula, no distinction is made between the part relative to the form of the baseline hazard and the one relative
to the effects of the covariates. Thus, time-dependent effects are naturally specified as interactions with some function of time via "*" or ":". See the examples below for more details.
The main functions of the survPen package are \code{\link{survPen}}, \code{\link{smf}}, \code{\link{tensor}}, \code{\link{tint}} and \code{\link{rd}}. The first one fits the model while the other four are constructors for penalized splines. \cr \cr
The user must be aware that the \code{survPen} package does not depend on \code{mgcv}. Thus, all the functionalities available in \code{mgcv} in terms of types of splines (such as thin plate regression splines or P-splines) are not available in \code{survPen} (yet).
}
\details{
In time-to-event analysis, we may deal with one or several continuous covariates whose functional forms, time-dependent effects and interaction structure are challenging. 
One possible way to deal with these effects and interactions is to use the classical approximation of the survival likelihood by a Poisson likelihood. Thus, by artificially splitting 
the data, the package \code{mgcv} can then be used to fit penalized hazard models (Remontet et al. 2018). The problem with this option is that the setup is rather complex and the method can fail with huge datasets (before splitting).  
Wood et al. (2016) provided a general penalized framework that made available smooth function estimation to a wide variety of models. 
They proposed to estimate smoothing parameters by maximizing a Laplace approximate marginal likelihood (LAML) criterion and demonstrate how statistical consistency is maintained by doing so.
The \code{\link{survPen}} function implements the framework described by Wood et al. (2016) for modelling time-to-event data without requiring data splitting and Poisson likelihood approximation.
The effects of continuous covariates are represented using low rank spline bases with associated quadratic penalties. The \code{\link{survPen}} function allows to account simultaneously for time-dependent effects, non-linear effects and
interactions between several continuous covariates without the need to build a possibly demanding model-selection procedure.
Besides LAML, a likelihood cross-validation (LCV) criterion (O’Sullivan 1988) can be used for smoothing parameter estimation.
First and second derivatives of LCV with respect to the smoothing parameters are implemented so that LCV optimization is computationally equivalent to the LAML optimization proposed by Wood et al. (2016).
In practice, LAML optimization is generally both a bit faster and a bit more stable so it is used as default. 
For \eqn{m} covariates \eqn{(x_1,\ldots,x_m)}, if we note \eqn{h(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)} the hazard at time \eqn{t}, the hazard model is the following :
\deqn{log[h(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)]=\sum_j g_j(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)}

where each \eqn{g_j} is either the marginal basis of a specific covariate or a tensor product smooth of any number of covariates. The marginal bases of the covariates are represented
as natural (or restricted) cubic splines (as in function \code{ns} from library \code{splines}) with associated quadratic penalties. Full parametric (unpenalized) terms for the effects of covariates are also possible (see the examples below).
Each \eqn{g_j} is then associated with zero, one or several smoothing parameters. 
The estimation procedure is based on outer Newton-Raphson iterations for the smoothing parameters and on inner Newton-Raphson iterations for the regression parameters (see Wood et al. 2016).
Estimation of the regression parameters in the inner algorithm is by direct maximization of the penalized likelihood of the survival model, therefore avoiding data augmentation and Poisson likelihood approximation. 
The cumulative hazard included in the log-likelihood is approximated by Gauss-Legendre quadrature for numerical stability.
}
\section{by variables}{

The \code{\link{smf}}, \code{\link{tensor}} and \code{\link{tint}} terms used to specify smooths accept an argument \code{by}. This \code{by} argument allows for building varying-coefficient models i.e. for letting
smooths ‘interact’ with factors or parametric terms. If a \code{by} variable is numeric, then its ith element multiples the ith row of the model matrix corresponding to the smooth term concerned.
If a \code{by} variable is a factor then it generates an indicator vector for each level of the factor, unless it is an ordered factor. In the non-ordered case, the model matrix for the smooth term is then replicated 
for each factor level, and each copy has its rows multiplied by the corresponding rows of its indicator variable. The smoothness penalties are also duplicated for each factor level. In short a different smooth is generated 
for each factor level. The main interest of by variables over separated models is the \code{same.rho} argument (for \code{\link{smf}}, \code{\link{tensor}} and \code{\link{tint}}) which allows forcing all smooths to have the same smoothing parameter(s). 
Ordered \code{by} variables are handled in the same way, except that no smooth is generated for the first level of the ordered factor. This is useful for setting up identifiable models when the same smooth occurs more than once 
in a model, with different factor \code{by} variables. Be careful in that case because you will need to add a reference smooth to make the model identifiable. See example 5 below.
}

\section{Random effects}{

i.i.d random effects can be specified using penalization. Indeed, the ridge penalty is equivalent to an assumption that the regression parameters are i.i.d. normal random effects.
Thus, it is easy to fit a frailty hazard model. For example, consider the model term \code{rd(clust)} which will result in a model matrix component corresponding to \code{model.matrix(~clust-1)} being added to the model matrix for the whole model. 
The associated regression parameters are assumed i.i.d. normal, with unknown variance (to be estimated). This assumption is equivalent to an identity penalty matrix (i.e. a ridge penalty) on the regression parameters.
The unknown smoothing parameter \eqn{\lambda} associated with the term \code{rd(clust)} is directly linked to the unknown variance \eqn{\sigma^2}: \eqn{\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda * S.scale}}.
Then, the estimated log standard deviation is: \eqn{log(\hat{\sigma})=-0.5*log(\hat{\lambda})-0.5*log(S.scale)}. And the estimated variance of the log standard deviation is: \eqn{Var[log(\hat{\sigma})]=0.25*Var[log(\hat{\lambda})]=0.25*inv.Hess.rho}. See example 6 below.
This approach allows implementing commonly used random effect structures. For example if \code{g} is a factor then \code{rd(g)} produces a random parameter for each level of g, the random parameters being i.i.d. normal. 
If \code{g} is a factor and \code{x} is numeric, then \code{rd(x,g)} produces an i.i.d. normal random slope relating the response to \code{x} for each level of \code{g}. If \code{h} is another factor then rd(h,g) produces the usual i.i.d. normal \code{g} - \code{h} interaction.

Thus, random effects treated as penalized splines allow specifying frailty (excess) hazard models (Charvat et al. 2016). For each individual i from cluster (usually geographical unit)  j, a possible model would be:
\deqn{log[h(t_{ij},x_{ij1},\ldots,x_{ijm})]=\sum_k g_k(t_{ij},x_{ij1},\ldots,x_{ijm}) + w_j}

where \code{w_j} follows a normal distribution with mean 0. The random effect associated with the cluster variable is specified with the model term \code{rd(cluster)}. We could also specify a random effect depending on age for example with the model term \code{rd(cluster,age)}.
\code{u_j = exp(w_j)} is known as the shared frailty.
}

\section{Excess hazard model}{

When studying the survival of patients who suffer from a common pathology we may be interested in the concept of excess mortality that represents the mortality due to that pathology. 
For example, in cancer epidemiology, individuals may die from cancer or from another cause. The problem is that the cause of death is often either unavailable or unreliable. 
Supposing that the mortality due to other causes may be obtained from the total mortality of the general population (called expected mortality for cancer patients), we can define the concept of excess mortality. 
The excess mortality is directly linked to the concept of net survival, which would be the observed survival if patients could not die from other causes. Therefore, when such competing events are present, 
one may choose to fit an excess hazard model instead of a classical hazard model. Flexible excess hazard models have already been proposed (for examples see Remontet et al. 2007, Charvat et al. 2016) but none of them deals with a penalized framework (in a non-fully Bayesian setting).
Excess mortality can be estimated supposing that, in patients suffering from a common pathology, mortality due to others causes than the pathology can be obtained from the (all cause) mortality of the general population; the latter is referred to as the expected mortality \eqn{h_P}. 
The mortality observed in the patients (\eqn{h_O}) is actually decomposed as the sum of \eqn{h_P} and the excess mortality due to the pathology (\eqn{h_E}). This may be written as:
\deqn{h_O(t,x)=h_E(t,x)+h_P(a+t,z)}
In that equation, \eqn{t} is the time since cancer diagnosis, \eqn{a} is the age at diagnosis, \eqn{h_P} is the mortality of the general population at age \eqn{a+t} given demographical characteristics \eqn{z} (\eqn{h_P} is considered known and available from national statistics), 
and \eqn{x} a vector of variables that may have an effect on \eqn{h_E}. Including the age in the model is necessary in order to deal with the informative censoring due to other causes of death. 
Thus, for \eqn{m} covariates \eqn{(x_1,\ldots,x_m)}, if we note \eqn{h_E(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)} the excess hazard at time \eqn{t}, the excess hazard model is the following:
\deqn{log[h_E(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)]=\sum_j g_j(t,x_1,\ldots,x_m)}
}

\section{Convergence}{

No convergence indicator is given. If the function returns an object of class \code{survPen}, it means that the algorithm has converged. If convergence issues occur, an error message is displayed.
If convergence issues occur, do not refrain to use detail.rho and/or detail.beta to see exactly what is going on in the optimization process. To achieve convergence, consider lowering step.max and/or changing rho.ini and beta.ini.
If your excess hazard model fails to converge, consider fitting a hazard model and use its estimated parameters as initial values for the excess hazard model. Finally, do not refrain to change the "method" argument (LCV or LAML) if convergence issues occur.
